üåç Flag Quiz App
A fun and interactive Android application developed in Kotlin that challenges your knowledge of world flags. This app is built with a strong emphasis on modern Android architectural patterns and efficient local data management.

‚ú® Features
Interactive Quizzes: Engage in multiple-choice quizzes to identify flags from various countries.

Persistent Data Storage: All quiz questions, flag images, and user progress (e.g., scores) are securely stored and managed locally.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive design for an enjoyable quizzing experience.

(Optional: Add more features if applicable, e.g., Difficulty Levels, Categories, High Score tracking, etc.)

üöÄ Technical Stack & Architecture
This project is engineered to demonstrate best practices in modern Android development, leveraging the following technologies and architectural principles:

Kotlin: The primary programming language, chosen for its conciseness, null safety, and modern features, ensuring robust and maintainable code.

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture:

Model: Represents the data layer, including Flag entities, quiz questions, and a data repository responsible for abstracting data sources (e.g., Room Database).

View: Android UI components (Activities and Fragments) that display the user interface, observe LiveData from the ViewModel, and dispatch user actions.

ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View. It exposes data streams to the UI via LiveData, handles UI-related logic, and manages asynchronous operations, ensuring the View is decoupled from business logic and lifecycle-aware.

Room Persistence Library: An abstraction layer over SQLite, part of Android Jetpack. It's used for:

Robust Local Data Storage: Efficiently stores structured data like flag details, quiz questions, and user scores.

Compile-time SQL Validation: Reduces runtime errors by validating SQL queries at compile time.

LiveData Integration: Seamlessly integrates with LiveData for reactive UI updates.

Android Jetpack Components: Utilizing various Jetpack libraries for modern development (e.g., Navigation Component for app flow, LiveData for observable data).

(Optional: Add other libraries you used, e.g., Coroutines for asynchronous operations, Glide/Coil for image loading, Hilt/Dagger for Dependency Injection)
